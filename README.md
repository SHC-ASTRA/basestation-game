# ASTRA basestation-game

Welcome! This is the repository for UAH's ASTRA Base Station for the University
Rover Challenge 2025-26.

ASTRA is a project under the AutoSat branch of Space Hardware Club at the
University of Alabama in Huntsville.

## If you're on basestation and no one is there to help you

1. Open up Godot

2. Press F5 on a keyboard, or click the Arrow icon on the top right
   of the screen on the steamdeck

If something doesn't work for whatever reason, you can try a few things:

- Close the window and the Godot game engine, restart from #1

- Open the Godot editor, open the ROS folder on the bottom right and run
  CompileRosMsgs.cs by right clicking on it, then re-run the program.

- Ping Roald Schaum in the ASTRA discord
